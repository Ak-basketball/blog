                <p class="day1">Solar-system was pretty hard to make, it took me at least 2 hours. While as I was coming back home at 11 in the night from my relatives house, I saw the stars and other objects in the sky. This led me to create Solar-system. I came across a lot of trials but in the end I finally created Solar-system</p>
