                <p class="day1">Calculator was pretty easy to make. As I was walking through Target, I saw a person having a hard time with the cash register. I realized that their has to be more apps to calculate in a more easier way. That's when I decided to make calculator. I firat made to input boxes, and 4 buttons. After some jQuery coding and css I finally finished making Calculator.</p>
